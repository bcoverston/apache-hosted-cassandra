 * by their cell path.
 * <p>
 * We can also distinguish different kind of cells based on the property of their

 *  1) "Normal" cells: their liveness info has no ttl and no deletion time.
 *  2) Expiring cells: their liveness info has both a ttl and a deletion time (the latter
 *    deciding when the cell is actually expired).
 *  3) Tombstones/deleted cells: their liveness info has a deletion time but no ttl. Those
 *     cells don't really have a value but their {@link #value} method return an empty
